# KernelPatch

**Patching and hooking the Linux kernel with only stripped Linux kernel image.**

``` shell
 _  __                    _ ____       _       _     
| |/ /___ _ __ _ __   ___| |  _ \ __ _| |_ ___| |__

```

- Obtain all symbol information without source code and symbol information.
- Inject arbitrary code into the kernel. (Static patching the kernel image or Runtime dynamic loading).
- Kernel function inline hook and syscall table hook are provided.
- Additional SU for Android.

If you are using Android, [APatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch) would be a better choice.
